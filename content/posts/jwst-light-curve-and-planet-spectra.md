### WASP-39b Light Curve and Planet Spectra

Recently, I worked on a cool project where I plotted the light curve of the star **WASP-39**, during which its exoplanet â€” the hot Jupiter **WASP-39b** â€” was also observed. According to [NASA's exoplanet archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/WASP-39#planet_WASP-39-b_collapsible), WASP-39b has about **0.28 times the mass of Jupiter** and a **radius 1.27 times that of Jupiter** (~91,000 km).  

It's a hot gas giant with a scorching temperature of around **900â€¯Â°C**. The planet orbits very close to its host star (about **7 million km away**) and completes one orbit in just **4 days**.  

WASP-39b was the **first exoplanet discovered to contain carbon dioxide in its atmosphere**, and sulfur dioxide was also detected. It lies in the **Virgo** constellation and is about **700 light-years away** from Earth. As part of the NameExoWorlds campaign for the IAUâ€™s 100th anniversary, the planet was officially named **Bocaprins**, after *Boca Prins* beach in Arubaâ€™s Arikok National Park. The star it orbits is **WASP-39**.

### What Is a Light Curve?

In simple terms, a **light curve** is a plot of incoming light (photon counts or flux) versus time. It shows how the brightness of a star changes over a period (called exposure time). Telescopes observe these light curves by continuously watching a star.  

One fascinating use of light curves is to detect exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of its star (a transit), it causes a small dip in the light curve â€” and thatâ€™s how astronomers discover new worlds!

### What Are Planet Spectra?

When telescopes use [CCD detectors](https://noirlab.edu/public/blog/50-years-ccds/), they can measure not just when photons arrive, but also their **energy** and **count**. Using this information, we can create a **spectrum** of the planet â€” which is basically a plot of photon flux (or counts) vs **wavelength**.  

This tells us what elements or molecules are present in the planetâ€™s atmosphere. Want to go deeper? Check out [this article on planetary spectroscopy](https://oxfordre.com/planetaryscience/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190647926.001.0001/acrefore-9780190647926-e-134).

### Datasets and Project Implementation

The dataset for this project came from the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)** using its **NIRSpec instrument**, specifically in **Bright Object Time-Series (BOTS)** mode. For more details, visit the [official JWST documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-spectrograph/nirspec-observing-modes/nirspec-bright-object-time-series-spectroscopy#gsc.tab=0).

The data was downloaded from the [MAST Portal](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html) and came in **FITS format**, which is the standard for astronomy data.

The project was done entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook**, and here are some of the interesting visualizations I generated:
