## My Open Source Journey  

It's been around **8 months** since I started contributing to **open source**, beginning with [OpenAstronomy](https://openastronomy.org/)!  

OpenAstronomy is an umbrella organization, and within it, I am an active contributor to:  
- [SunPy](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy) 
- [Stingray Software](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray)  

### An Incredible Journey So Far  
This journey has been **amazing**! I've had the opportunity to interact with incredible peopleâ€”some are **researchers**, some work at **NASA** and **ESA**, and others are **professors at top universities**.  

Through open source, I've learned **a lot** about:  
- Computational Astronomy  
- Coding Standards   
- Unit Testing with `pytest` 
- Documentation with `Sphinx` 
- Pre-commit Hooks 
- learned how to work with File formats like `FITS` and `ASDF` 

By the way i got into open source around september 2024 and journey has been amazing so far!!
