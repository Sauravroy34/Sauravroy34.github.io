### Motive
Ever felt frustrated while reading through legal documents? Or ever felt overwhelmed by the overly "formal" and boring vocabulary? Then worry not, here's a project I made, Legal Ease, a legal document summariser It's built with Gemini api, and for the UI Streamlit is used, and the project is hosted on Streamlit Cloud.It supports PDF and image, and also has a chat interface for further queries.
